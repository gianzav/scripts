# Gianzav's scripts

Here are some scripts that I use in my usual workflow.

* **backup**: backup tool, *unfinished*
* **bar**: status bar info, used with [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial/)
* **batnotify**: notification triggered by a low level of battery, used as a
  cron job or systemd timer
* **compile**: markdown to pdf compiler through pandoc
* **dmenu_col**: dmenu with some tweaks to make it gruvbox-friendly
* **gitbranch**: if in a git repo, tells just the current branch (i use it to
  show the current branch in the shell prompt)
* **icon_select**: icon/emoji selector (feed it with a file that contains the
  icons line by line)
* **lofi**: starts the lofi hip hop radio in mpv (could be an alias, a
  standalone script it's a bit too much)
* **newdoc**: makes a new text file based on the date and a prefix
* **power-dmenu**: a menu to manage suspension/shutdown, *unfinished*
* **prompt**: yes/no dmenu prompt to execute a command passed by argument
* **voc**: command line tool to search a word in Treccani online dictionary
  (all in the terminal *it's not just a link to the website*)

If you land on this page and want to contribute to my scripts, currently I would
like to add more features to **voc** with other languages and translation
capabilities.
